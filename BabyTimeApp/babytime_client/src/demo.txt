Background: I graduated from Simon Fraser University with a Bachelor's degree in Business, with a concentration in Management of Information System and Interantional Business.  
            I've always had an interest in programming, so during my time at SFU, I took several computer science courses, 
            and that's when I realized that web development was something that I wanted to do as a career. 
            However, my circumstances at the time didn't allow me to purse a double degree, so I had to put my dream on hold. 
            Lucky for me, my employer, Jane App, provided me with an amazing opportunity to fulfil my dream by learning web development through Code Core's bootcamp. 
            I really hope that I can take advantage of this opportunity to purse a career as a full stack web developer,
            and build meaningful products that can benefit many people.


About Final Project: The app that I built is called BabyTime, and the purpose of the app is to help new parents to stay on top of the parenting game.
                     You can record and track baby's activities, so when the baby starts to cry, you know exactly 
                     what your baby needs!
